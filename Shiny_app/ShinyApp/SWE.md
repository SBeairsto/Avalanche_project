Snow water equivalent (SWE), measured in mm, is the amount of water contained in the snowpack. In other words, if we were to melt the entire snowpack in a flash, how much water would we be left with? Our primary interest in this measurement is to determine the total daily precipitation (snowfall). To do this, we take the hourly change in SWE and sum all positive values over the past 24hrs. 
  
SWE has traditionally been measured using snow pillows. Snow pillows are three-metre diameter polyurethane pillows, filled with anti-freeze and water, which measure the amount of water in the snowpack through the hydrostatic pressure of snow sitting on top of the pillow. As snow accumulates on the pillow, the snow's weight pushes an equal weight of the antifreeze-water solution from the pillow up into an open standpipe. The distance the anti-freeze is pushed up the standpipe relative to the zero value is equal to the snowpack's SWE.

While the SWE data seems robust (explore the data chart below), it has several drawbacks. First, it becomes less reliable as a measurement of snowfall during the melt season. Furthermore, SWE measurements are susceptible to bridging in deep freezes and freeze-thaw cycles and evaporation/sublimation/drifting of snow on the snow pillow. Bridging occurs when ice-layers form in the snowpack, supporting the snow's weight, removing pressure from the snow pillow.
