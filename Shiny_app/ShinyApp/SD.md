Snow depth (SD), measured in cm, again is a relatively self-explanatory measurement. SD is measured using an acoustic distance sensor that usually sits 3 â€“ 5 metres above the ground and measures the elapsed time between emission and return of an ultrasonic pulse to determine the snow's distance. A simple calculation is performed from the summer zero value to then produce the current snow depth.

 Intuitively, this measurement would be the most direct measurement of snowfall. However, during heavy snowfall, SD can actually decrease due to gravitational settling. Furthermore, due to its acoustic nature, SD measurements are susceptible to wind/rain/snowfall messing them up. The data's unreliability can be seen in the plots below, where poor readings are set to a default max reading of approximately 800cm.
